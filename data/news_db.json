    "content": "SILVER and PLATINUM extended this week's sharp gains on Friday, outpacing 'safe haven' gold to hit new multi-year highs as Western stock markets also rose with copper and crude oil prices, as did lease rates for borrowing the industrially-useful precious metals. New data today said GDP across the Euro area, the world's 3rd largest currency zone economically, grew 1.5% per year between January and March, 0.3 points faster than Eurostat's original Q1 estimate. Retail sales across the 20-nation Eurozone then leapt past analyst forecasts for April, and the USA added more jobs than expected in May, with average wages in the world's largest economy continuing to rise by 3.9% per year, solidly above the latest inflation data. \"Silver, platinum and copper surged past key levels,\" says precious metals strategist Nicky Shiels at Swiss bullion refining and finance group MKS Pamp. \"The charts across all 3 look the same [with] technical momentum, improving fundamentals, growing investor interest.\" Fixing around $36.15 per Troy ounce today, silver set its highest midday benchmark price in London since the spike of 29 February 2012. On a weekly basis, and following Thursday's huge silver price move, that marked silver's highest Friday fix for almost 14 years, adding 9.3% from last week-end. That's the steepest Dollar-price jump in silver since its 17.7% rebound of mid-August 2020, back amid the first-wave Covid Crisis. Gold bullion meanwhile fixed close to mid-May's record weekend level, trading above $3340 per Troy ounce at 3pm in London before falling $10 by the close of trade. Year-to-date, platinum now matches the former 'monetary' metals' gains in percentage terms, trading at $1168 per ounce around Friday's 2.30pm bullion auction with a 9.0% jump for the week. \"This collective breakout in industrial metals signals larger capital flows seeking 'gold alternatives' [in] the debasement/dedollarization narrative,\" reckons Shiels at MKS. \"[But] each metal [also] has their unique demand story. \"Strong physical silver demand in India is industrial related. Resurgent Chinese platinum demand [is for] investment and jewelry. There's a base metals restocking cycle in China [plus] a more widely-known micro story in copper.\" With copper stockpiles available for delivery against London Metal Exchange contracts falling to 2-year lows, US copper stockpiles have doubled so far in 2025 to the most since Trump's first-term trade tariffs panic. Silver has meantime begun to come back out of Comex-approved storage on the US east coast after swelling by nearly 3/5ths, while US gold stockpiles have shrunk 15% from start-April's record high after nearly tripling amid the same fears of import tariffs hitting bullion, driving Comex futures contracts sharply above London quotes and sucking in metal. One-month lease rates for borrowing platinum in London today rose over 1 percentage point to 12.5% per annum, the highest since end-March, eve of Trump's 'Liberation Day' trade tariffs announcement, when precious metals in bullion form were explicitly excluded. Silver lease rates meantime edged up to 0.5% per annum, the highest in almost 2 weeks but back down to more normal levels from the tariff panic peak of 7.5% seen in March. Gold 1-month lease rates also edged up, but remained negative − costing the lender 0.14% per year more than they would earn in interest on the cash exchanged for the metal, implying much more plentiful London supplies. Silver and platinum's fellow industrial precious metal palladium also jumped in price this week, adding 7.5% to a 7-month high, more than 3 times the weekly gain in gold. US Treasury bonds fell in contrast, pushing up Washington's 10-year borrowing costs by 0.08 percentage points from last Friday to a 2-week high of 4.48% per annum as the better-than-expected jobs data coincided with President Trump falling out with former supporter and donor Elon Musk on social media.",

NO REVERSAL yet in the Silver/Gold ratio, writes Gary Tanashian in his Notes from the Rabbit Hole, flipping the more common Gold/Silver Ratio on its head, the better to measure silver in terms of the less useful 'safe haven' precious metal. In fact, quite the contrary as the ratio makes its 5th day fading after a spike last week. The Silver/Gold ratio, in other words, remains extremely depressed. That in itself is not a big deal. It's a normal consolidation of the spike. But the nominal silver price, which had been conspicuously strong above its 50-day moving average despite the correction in gold and the miners, is slipping said level. If that is an indication of things to come, the sector correction should continue and other areas in commodities/resources could come under renewed pressure. A reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio would trigger a positive market for commodities/resources. The question is, will the recent dive bomb in the silver price vs. the gold price prove to be a pivotal event, as it did in 2020? Will a reversal in the Silver/Gold ratio come from this drop? If so, given relatively less downside intensity than 2020, I'd expect the upside to be highly tradable, but more moderate (sorry my silver buggish friends). (By the way, above, and outside of the P-51 Mustang, the Junkers JU87 'Stuka' dive bomber was this WWII fighter dork's favorite of the era. It's a bomber, but work with me here. It was so awkward and clumsy.) Silver, with more cyclical industrial utility than gold, would lead if inflationary pressures build up and/or renewed enthusiasm against a coming recession/bust were to manifest. Further implications would be for strength in the precious metals miners, despite a currently in-process healthy pullback, and further weakness in the US Dollar, which has been bearish for the entirety of Trump's term. As a side note, USD is due for a bounce or rally. But \"due\" implies a time variable. Meanwhile, the TSX-V index, home of the most speculative Canadian commodity/resource related stocks, has ticked a new high for its bottom/upturn cycle. The 'V' seems to think silver will take over from gold, potentially providing a backdrop for wider commodity participation. Only time will tell if this will play out, but it's interesting goings-on in a macro stimulated by an awful lot of geopolitical input.",

    "content": "For most purposes there is a safer, easier and cheaper way to buy than coins. But if you wish to own coins there are indeed a number of bullion gold coins in the world. Bullion gold coins are used as an alternative form of wealth storage to traditional currency. The attraction of bullion gold coins is that they retain near full value regardless of either change of government or being transported outside their country of issue. These are not 'numismatic' gold coins. Bullion coins are not rare, and their value is simply computed by multiplying their gold content by the price. Numismatic coins on the other hand are rare coins and are considered collectibles. Numismatic gold coin prices are more volatile than bullion coin prices, because their prices move both with the changes in value of bullion gold, and with the emotions of coin collectors. 31.104 grams = 1 troy oz. Check gram/troy ounce prices Gold coins were hardly produced anywhere between 1933 and 1965. Then, once the private demand for gold ownership had been nearly extinguished, it was finally the South Africans who started minting again in earnest from 1967. As you can see, several governments are now minting gold coins again. Generally these gold coins are not available direct from the producing mint. Instead the mints have arrangements with distributing sales agents who deal with the public. The mints themselves take a premium over the gold content (known as seignorage), and the agents add a further intermediary margin. There is nowhere in the world that any of these gold coins circulate as money. Gresham's Law states that \"Bad money drives good money out of circulation\". It applies brutally on gold coins. Many gold bugs struggle to understand why gold is not a popular and widely circulating medium of exchange. Gresham's law explains it. Imagine you had a pocket full of fast depreciating dollars (or any other currency), and a gold coin. You are about to pay for something and both are accepted by the merchant. Which do you choose? That's all there is to it! Bad money is losing value all the time, so people wisely spend it, and save the good money. Not being used does not mean that gold coins are somehow inferior to bank-notes: quite the opposite in fact. It means that their good wealth storage characteristics means they don't circulate. The result is self-reinforcing. Where there are lots of fast depreciating bank-notes about few people ever handle a gold coin, so they stop even accepting them when they are offered. They soon neither recognise the gold coin offered nor understand its value. Then what tends to happen is that the skill to deal in gold coins (without getting duped by fakes) concentrates on a few expert gold coin dealers, and that increases the cost of dealing. They benefit from the value of their specialised knowledge, and you pay for your lack of it. Nowadays gold coin dealing is perfectly legal and there is open trading of gold coins - usually tax free. Yet even now you will pay a premium of 6-10% above the underlying gold price for trading small numbers of gold coins with a gold coin dealer. Then, when it comes to sell, you will have to accept a substantial discount for your gold coins too. That might cost you another 2-6% Meanwhile should an economic meltdown occur your gold coins would probably not be very useful. One possibility is that they would be subject to compulsory purchase (confiscation) by a government at a significant discount to their real value - as happened in USA in 1933. Then the owner has either (i) to surrender his gold coins for a loss, (ii) to store them secretly, unused and unusable, or (iii) to dispose of them - dangerously - through illegal channels to underground gold coin traders, who will pay only a deeply discounted price. Perhaps more likely - and indeed this has been the case for most countries for most of history - exchange controls will be re-introduced. You cannot carry or ship gold out of a country which is under exchange controls. This is why people who understand the issues choose to store only a small emergency reserve as bullion gold coins. They expect to use them only in extreme circumstances. They put the bulk of their gold denominated wealth store offshore, and usually as close to a professional and highly liquid bullion market as they can. You too can do this using BullionVault. If you can own gold in a country whose currency is not in crisis, which has a solid tradition of protecting foreigners' property rights, whose politics are stable, and whose enemies are few, then your gold will in almost all circumstances offer you better protection there than if you store it domestically. That is why your gold coin purchase should be treated as your emergency reserve, and not as your strategic store of wealth. Tell me more about the smarter way to buy gold. The underlying value of gold bullion coins is calculated by multiplying the coin’s gold content by the current price of gold in the buyer’s chosen currency. While a buyer (or seller) must then allow for retailer mark-ups (or dealer discounts) totaling 3-8% or more, this means that how much a gold coin is worth changes with the live ‘spot price’ of gold, which you can track using BullionVault’s live gold price chart. The value of ‘numismatic’ gold coins has less direct relationship with the wholesale bullion market. Their worth is dictated by the coin's rarity, its collectability, and also buyer sentiment, rather than by their pure gold content. This means it may be less prone to fluctuation short term. Because all 1 oz bullion coins will contain 1 ounce of fine gold, the underlying value is the same whichever gold coin you choose. Different coins may seem better or worse however when you consider the 'spread' between prices to buy and prices to sell, because buyers must pay a mark-up, above what the gold coin is worth, and sellers will typically get back less than that value. The value of gold coins is calculated by multiplying the coin’s gold content by the current price of gold in the buyer’s chosen currency. Therefore, the ‘spot price’ value of all 1 oz gold bullion coins with the same pure gold content will be the same. However, the first 1-troy ounce gold bullion coin minted was the South African Krugerrand, which remains one of the most popular gold coins in the world. For UK taxpayers, the 1-ounce Britannia can seem the best gold coin to buy, because it is free of capital gains tax when you sell. But that's almost always a red herring for UK investors, because the extra costs you pay to buy and sell Britannias soon eat up any of the likely benefit for most people. Investing in gold is typically seen as a good way of hedging against risk as part of a balanced portfolio. Gold bullion coins tend to track the professional bullion market's pattern of increasing in value as other investment assets fall during financial crisis or economic downturns. However, the gap between prices to buy and prices to sell can be wide, running to 10-15% on some coins. This cost should be factored in when considering gold coins as an investment. Collectible gold coins – known as numismatic coins – find their investment value dictated more by their rarity and trends in collecting rather than by their pure gold content. It depends which country you live in. No banks sell gold coins in the UK for instance, and banks that sell gold coins are few and far between in the USA or Canada. But Germany's banks often make it possible to buy gold bars or coins at their local branches. While banks may not sell gold coins where you live, many national mints produce gold bullion coins as well as rarer, limited edition gold coins. For example, the Royal Mint produces both a regular version of its gold Sovereign coin as well as commemorative editions, such as the 2012 Royal Mint gold sovereign coin, minted to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. The karat system is used most often in jewelry. But many 1-ounce bullion coins are 24 karat - sometimes called 24 carat - which means they are 99.99% pure gold or better. These 24 karat gold coins include UK Britannias, American Buffalos, Australia's Kangaroo, Austrian Philharmonics, and Canadian Maples. While the 24 karat gold coins have what's known as 9999 millesimal fineness, other very popular coins like the British Sovereign and the American Eagle, are 22 karat = 0.9167 fine. Large wholesale bullion bars must be 995 parts per 1,000 pure gold. But here, in the professional market, you only ever pay for the fine gold content. No one ever pays for the other 5 parts per thousand. As explained above, owning wholesale bullion in a market-accredited vault is the safer, cheaper and easier way to own gold, silver, platinum and palladium. That said, we recognize that some people also like to keep a little bullion at home, and so we now enable UK users to withdraw gold in the form of a 100 gram bar.",

With SILVER PRICES setting fresh record highs outside the US Dollar, investing in the precious metal \"is inching towards the mainstream\" reports The Economist magazine as leading analysts forecast a wide deficit of supply to meet global demand for the 5th year running. Yet another new record for silver industrial demand will help offset weaker jewelry purchases – dented by silver's strong price rise – according to analysis from specialist consultancy Metals Focus for the Washington-based Silver Institute. Like silver's industrial and other productive uses – led by \"ongoing structural gains in green economy applications\" such as silver's solar energy technology – silver bullion investing is forecast to rise 3% by weight in 2025, the Silver Institute says. Because \"as Western investors adjust to new price levels, fresh investment is expected to improve, and profit-taking will also ease.\" Mining output will rise 2% and scrap recycling will rise 5% on Metals Focus' outlook, cutting the gap between total supply and global demand by 1/5th but \"still sizeable historically\". Setting its highest annual average price since 2012 at $28.20 per Troy ounce last year, silver bullion set a new all-time annual high in UK Pounds and the Euro at £22.10 and €26.13. Silver in February then set a new month-average nominal high in Pounds Sterling at £25.68 –topping April 2011 by 1 penny – and set its highest Euro-equivalent average since the historic peak of New Year 1980 (based on the Deutsche Mark conversion rate) at €30.91 per ounce. That still left the precious metal far below those tops after accounting for inflation, at barely 1/3rd the month-average value of January 1980 in real terms. For 2025, twenty-four of the 25 analysts entering their silver-price prediction into this year's LBMA Forecast Survey are bullish. The other projects that silver's average price will match 2024's decade record in Dollar terms and also foresees an intra-year peak above $40, almost 25% higher than current levels. \"Silver is to outperform all precious metals in 2025,\" says the LBMA survey's most bullish silver forecaster, strategist Nicky Shiels at Swiss bullion refining and finance group MKS Pamp. Predicting an average price of $36.50 per ounce – higher than silver's nominal 2011 record of $35.11 – Shiels points to \"synchronised central bank rate cuts, a more supportive China and US macroeconomic backdrop, still strong solar demand, and ultimately a lower US Dollar.\" Priced in the Dollar, silver has so far averaged $31.32 in 2025, and it's currently averaging £25.11 in Sterling and €30.08 in Euros. Silver also set a new annual record in Indian Rupees last year, with a fresh month-average high of 900 INR per 10 grams in February. Yet despite the industrially-useful precious metal's new price highs, Indian silver imports have jumped says Metals Focus, up 37% in January from 12 months before to the heaviest New Year inflows since at least 2008. Boosted by last summer's surprise cut to silver (and gold) bullion import duty, \"This was fuelled by continued strength in investment demand,\" says the consultancy, forecasting in its latest India Focus Monthly that the subcontinent's investing should \"remain robust\" even as higher prices dent jewellery and silverware demand. For silver investment, the \"widening gulf between supply and demand looks likely to keep the frenzy going,\" says this week's Economist magazine, now with more than 1 million subscribers worldwide, noting the recent dislocation between US Comex futures and London bullion prices. BullionVault users as well as AI silver forecasts for 2025 are strongly bullish, predicting year-end Dollar prices as high as $36 per Troy ounce .",

    "content": "Most new bullion buyers in nearly 4 years... GOLD INVESTING has leapt as Trump 2.0 delivers exactly the policy chaos which the new President promised in the US election, writes Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault. The safe haven's latest surge to new record prices is seeing sentiment, demand and new accounts openings jump to multi-year highs on BullionVault, taking the value of securely-stored gold owned by investors using our 24/7 service above $4.0 billion for the first time (£3.2bn, €3.8bn, ¥606bn). With the number of new investors rising last month to the highest count since May 2021, the total number of people starting or adding to their gold holdings on BullionVault rose 33.6% from January's figure, while the number of people selling gold across the month fell 17.0% despite gold's new record prices offering fresh profits. Together that raised the Gold Investor Index by 3.6 points – the strongest rise in 10 months – to 56.3, its highest reading since October 2022. The Gold Investor Index tracks the balance of gold buyers versus sellers each month, starting in 2009. It set a decade peak of 65.9 in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic went global, and it fell to a record low of 47.5 last March as gold's rising price spurred heavy profit-taking by existing owners. Any reading above 50.0 would signal that the number of buyers perfectly matched the number of sellers across the month. What's spurring this jump? Western investors are joining emerging-market central banks in buying gold as an all-weather hedge. Traders in all markets are now watching Truthsocial more closely than monetary policy. Volatility is also helping. Gold prices swung around 6% in all major currencies last month, offering longer-term holders the chance to book a profit before buying the dip alongside new investors. Priced in the Dollar, gold set 10 new record high prices in February, matching the count of September 2011 – peak of the 'safe haven' metal's global financial crisis bull market – with the most since October 1978's record monthly count of 12. In Euro and UK Pound terms, gold also continued its run of new all-time highs, extending 2024's record count of new gold price highs in terms of those currencies. BullionVault finds 9-in-10 its 110,000 customers in Western Europe and North America. From here in Hammersmith, West London, our regular investor surveys say that BullionVault users typically hold four-fifths of their investable wealth in other assets besides precious metals. New Year 2025's survey showed that geopolitics now tops the list of gold price drivers, overtaking monetary policy for the first time since Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine began in 2022. New users funding their account last month to buy bullion for the first time rose 22.4% from January's count and jumped 62.5% from its 12-month average to the biggest figure since May 2021. That was led by the UK (up 80.9% from its 12-month average to the most since March 2021), Germany (up 89.3% to the most since March 2022) and the USA (up 137.4% to the most since April 2023). So the upturn in European gold buyers which we've seen and reported since the eve of the US election in October continues spreading to US investors, but from a lower base historically. Also note that, worldwide, this jump in bullion demand remains far from a gold rush right now. While February brought the most first-time buyers to BullionVault in almost four years, that number was less than half the peak of either the Covid Crisis in August 2020 or the global financial crisis in September 2011, when gold's then-record prices set what proved to be a longer-term top. By weight in February, and net of customer profit-taking, BullionVault's 24/7 marketplace witnessed the strongest gold investor demand since June 2023 at 0.2 tonnes. More than reversing January's net outflow, that demand saw the total quantity of BullionVault clients' gold – all securely stored and insured in specialist warehouses in each user's choice of London, New York, Singapore, Toronto or Zurich – rise to a 3-month high above 44.1 tonnes. Up 0.4% from January's 4.5-year low, client gold holdings increased 1.1% to the 9th new all-time record of the past 12 months, rising above $4.0 billion for the first time. After falling below 50.0 in January to signal more sellers than buyers for the 5th time in 12 months, the Silver Investor Index rose 2.2 points to read 51.9 in February. By weight, however, BullionVault users were net sellers of silver, cutting their holdings as a group for the first time in 4 months and liquidating almost 5 tonnes as the more industrially-useful precious metal set new month-average records in UK Pounds and most other non-US currencies outside the Euro. That took total client holdings down 0.4% by weight to 1,151 tonnes worth $1.1bn (£915m, €1.1bn, ¥173bn). Precious metals investing, in other words, currently favors the safe haven of gold over the industrial-growth story of silver. But while that matches the geopolitical and economic outlook as Trump 2.0 turns eight decades of Western military and trading alliances on their head, investor sentiment is positive towards both precious metals as they trade at new all-time record prices.",
    "summary": "Most new bullion buyers in nearly 4 years... GOLD INVESTING has leapt as Trump 2.0 delivers exactly the policy chaos which the new President promised in the US election, writes Adrian Ash at world-leading precious metals marketplace BullionVault. The safe haven's latest surge to new record prices is seeing sentiment, demand and new accounts openings jump to multi-year highs on BullionVault, taking the value of securely-stored gold owned by investors using our 24/7 service above $4.0 billion for the first time (£3.2bn, €3.8bn, ¥606bn).",

    "content": "Are you investing in gold? Then can we suggest reading how the gold markets work? It will save you money by helping you avoid a purchase of gold costing 10% more than it should. You needn't make that mistake. We can show you clearly how to buy the most trusted form of gold in the world, at the best prices, and in the safest, easiest way. If you're still thinking about Gold Investment, and rationalising what can be a difficult decision we recommend reading this link before you invest in gold. Gold investment worldwide has grown dramatically in the last five years, but compared with the total stock of financial assets, gold bullion investment is still just a tiny proportion. Several factors are now stimulating gold investment by new pension fund money - as well as by private investors. Sales of gold jewelry across Asia are surging as the local economies boom and private investment grows. China's gold investment demand grew by 20% in 2007, while Indian consumers bought a record 900 tonnes - well over one-fifth of the total world market. Gold buyers in Asia tend to think of their jewelry as a form of gold investment. Prevented from owning gold bullion until very recently, they invest in gold to protect their savings from inflation and currency shocks. That's why the most popular form of gold jewelry in Asia - heavy chains and bracelets - is known as \"investment jewelry\" in the gold industry. Gold mining companies worldwide have failed to meet the growing demand from gold jewelry and gold investment buyers, pushing the gold price steadily higher. The former world's No.1 gold mining nation, South Africa, has seen its annual gold output halve since 1998, and new operations in China and Russia - though growing - have failed to pick up the slack. According to consultants \"Virtual Metals\" total world mining output has fallen by 4% since 2003. Their gold investment analysts don't forecast an early return to growing output. As the US Dollar has slumped gold investment has outstripped the gains in all major world currencies. In the five years to 2008 buying Euros to defend against the Dollar's decline has returned 47%. Gold investment, on the other hand, has returned 131%. British, Australian, South African and Indian citizens undertaking gold investments in 2007 all enjoyed the gold price reaching record new all-time highs. The surge in crude oil prices has closely matched the gains in gold prices since 2003, but many people now thinking about gold investment will also want to consider the surge in world food prices, the boom in base metals such as copper, and the current all-time highs in the cost of shipping. Rising demand for better housing and durable goods from Asian consumers is certainly a factor. But many gold investment analysts also point to the huge growth in credit and debt in the West. The money supply in the United States has doubled in the last seven years. In Europe, growth in the money supply hit a near-30 year record in late 2007, increasing the appeal of gold investment as the value of each Euro in circulation threatens to shrink under the weight of new notes and electronic account balances. \"Financial innovation in the last few years has been extremely strong and powerful,\" as Gilles Gilcenstein, head of asset management at BNP Paribas, put it in late 2006. We've now seen this bubble in complex and novel investments bite back. The global credit crunch first bit when the alphabet soup of MBS, CDOs, CDS and ABCP turned sour as the US mortgage market turned down. These instruments thrive in the opaque, off-balance-sheet environment of modern financial engineering. But transparency is important. The modern world has audited accounts, and open exchanges, and 'public' companies for a good reason: because previous generations understood that when investment stops being open and transparent, and reverts to cosy secret deals, complex contracts, and big executive bonuses, then it is general investors who get cheated. Transparency helps stop these problems developing. In stark contrast to the burgeoning complexity of modern securities markets gold investment remains uniquely simple, and - dealt the right way - uniquely transparent. A solid gold investment sets you free from the risk of credit default or banking failures. Click here for essential information if you are considering or ready to invest in gold. Gold investing can make a good idea for spreading risk across a balanced portfolio. That's because the value of gold bullion has tended to increase when other investment assets fall over long periods of time. Historical trends show that investing in gold has made a good if imperfect hedge against poor performance from currencies, shares, bonds and real estate. The idea is to reduce overall losses by using gold to diversify the portfolio's investments. When investing in gold as a way to spread risk, it's a good idea to think about costs, security and simplicity. For more information on gold investment, read the dedicated guide above. Choosing the best gold investment will depend on the buyer’s resources and aims. A few gold coins or a very small bar hidden at home needn't cost much. But compared to serious investment gold, they are very expensive by weight, reducing gains or worsening losses if prices fall. Proper insurance really is vital. Owning gold within a Good Delivery bar, cast by an LBMA-approved refiner and insured inside market-recognized vaults, makes a safer and more cost-effective way of investing in gold. Because the metal's quality and authenticity are warranted, the price spreads (the difference between buying and selling prices) are very tight, and commission fees are lower than for all other bullion products. For more information on gold investment, read our dedicated guide above. The best way to invest in gold bullion will depend on the buyer’s resources, as well as their intentions. For example, gold coins and small gold bars are available, with bars ranging in size from 1 gram upwards. But these cost very much more by weight than larger bullion products. Owning gold within Good Delivery bars, cast by LBMA-approved refiners and weighing around 400 Troy ounces (12.5 kilograms), offers the best way to invest in gold if the buyer wants value, security and the ability to sell quickly for full value. Stored and insured in specialist vaults, this large-bar gold comes with a warranty of quality and authenticity. It enjoys the tightest trading price spread – the difference between buying and selling prices – and commission fees are lower than any other bullion product. For more information on gold investment, read our dedicated guide above. Gold bullion is viewed by many investors as a good way of hedging against risk as part of a balanced portfolio. This is because the value of gold has historically increased as cash, currencies, stocks and bonds lost value, helping reduce overall losses when other assets in an investment portfolio dip. There are many different ways to invest in gold bullion. Good Delivery bars offer the most cost-effective product, because the deep, global market for these large units makes the price spread (the difference between buying and selling prices) tighter than for any other form of bullion. For more information on gold investment, read our dedicated guide above. Some analysts and advisors think investing in gold is a bad idea because it doesn't pay any income or interest. But gold bullion is more widely seen as a good alternative investment, hedging against risk, as part of a balanced portfolio. Historically, the value of gold has repeatedly increased when domestic currencies, stocks and bonds have performed badly over extended periods of time. This 'see-saw' performance isn't guaranteed however, and gold can fall alongside stocks and bonds during short-term crises. Over longer periods, gold prices show a similar volatility to the stock market, and most investors using gold to balance risk from other portfolio assets should expect gold to underperform when the economy is growing and wider investment sentiment is positive.
